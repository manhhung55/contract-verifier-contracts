# contract-verifier-contracts

A sources registry contract for registering a data url for a given code cell hash.
The contract accepts messages from a designated verifier registry contract.

Implementation is based on [TEP-91 suggestion](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/pull/91).

This repo is a part of the following:
1. [contract-verifier-contracts](https://github.com/ton-community/contract-verifier-contracts) (this repo) - Sources registry contracts which stores an on-chain proof per code cell hash.
2. [contract-verifier-backend](https://github.com/ton-community/contract-verifier-backend) - Backend for compiling FunC and returning a signature over a message containing the resulting code cell hash.
3. [contract-verifier-sdk](https://github.com/ton-community/contract-verifier-sdk) - A UI component to fetch and display sources from Ton blockchain and IPFS, including code highlighting.
4. [contract-verifier](https://github.com/ton-community/contract-verifier) - A UI app to interact with the backend, contracts and publish an on-chain proof.

## E2E tests
(e2e.ts in test/e2e)
1. Pre-deploy (using `npm run build && npm run deploy`) the sources registry contract -> change min_tons in sources_registry.fc to a small amount, otherwise tests are too costly. 
2. Provide two mnemonics via .env
3. Flows carried out:
   * (Sender: wallet1) Change admin from wallet1 to wallet2
   * (Sender: wallet2) Change verifier address from actual to zero address; then revert to actual
   * (Sender: wallet2) Set code to `EQAThFLJkzuWl5hlhKPh2yWrIJ6dcx5Mbg0bJnb6MbhM9Tpa`; then revert to original
   * (Sender: wallet2) Change admin from wallet2 to wallet1
   * (Sender: wallet1) Set source item code to `...?.fc`; then revert to original
